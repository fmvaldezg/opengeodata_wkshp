**Using Open Geospatial Data in GIS**

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to accessing, exploring, and downloading open geospatial data from [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) (OSM) and [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org/) for use in Geographic Information Systems, specifically [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).

The tutorial walks through practical steps for:
•	Exploring data in both platforms' web interfaces
•	Setting up QGIS to view OSM data as raster tiles
•	Using the QuickOSM plugin to download specific OSM data (like parking facilities in Philadelphia)
•	Installing and configuring required plugins (QduckDB and GeoParquet Downloader) to access Overture Maps data
•	Downloading and opening data in different formats

The guide includes detailed instructions with screenshots for each step, troubleshooting tips for different operating systems, and explanations of technical concepts like GeoParquet format.
