    "text": "2 Sources reviewed in this tutorial\nIn this guide, we’ll explore ways to access and use open geospatial data, focusing on OpenStreetMap and Overture Maps for Geographic Information Systems (QGIS specifically). These tools are powerful resources that anyone can use to work with location-based data.\n\n2.1 OpenStreetMap OSM\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative world map that anyone can edit and use - think of it like “Wikipedia for maps.” It is created by volunteers worldwide who add and update geographic information about roads, buildings, parks, businesses, and other features. People contribute data based on their local knowledge, GPS tracks, aerial imagery, and field surveys.\nKey aspects of OSM:\n\nCommunity-driven: The data is collected and maintained by a global community of mappers, from hobbyists to professional geographers.\nTruly open: Unlike commercial maps, OSM data is freely available for anyone to download, use, and modify under an open license (Open Database License).\nUsed everywhere: The data powers thousands of applications and services - from humanitarian crisis response to navigation apps, urban planning tools, and games.\nConstantly updated: Because anyone can contribute, OSM often has more up-to-date information than commercial maps, especially in rapidly changing areas or after natural disasters.\n\nThese are only some of the communities building OSM. Explore more communities here\n\nThe project started in 2004 in the UK and has grown into one of the largest collaborative mapping efforts in the world. Today, OSM is often considered the most comprehensive free source of geographic data available.\nAlthough you don’t need an account to explore the map, you can sign up if you want to contribute edits or be part of the communities related to the project.\n\n\n\n2.2 Overture Maps\n\nOverture Maps is a newer collaborative effort launched in 2022 by major tech companies including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), and TomTom. It combines information from multiple sources - including commercial datasets, open data, and machine learning - to create a high-quality, standardized global map.\nKey aspects of Overture Maps:\n\nQuality-focused: It uses sophisticated data validation and conflation techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency of geographic information.\nBusiness-friendly: While free and open like OSM, it’s specifically designed to meet enterprise-level mapping needs with reliable, standardized data.\nModern architecture: Built from the ground up to handle today’s mapping challenges, with a focus on regular updates and clear data lineage.\nMultiple sources: Instead of relying solely on volunteer contributions, it combines different data sources including commercial data, open data, and machine-derived features.\n\nThe project released its first major dataset in 2023 and aims to provide an alternative foundation for building mapping applications and services. While newer than OSM, it’s designed to complement rather than compete with existing open mapping projects."

    "text": "3 Exploring the data\n\n3.1 In OpenStreetMap\n01 Go to https://www.openstreetmap.org/ on your web browser\n\nThe screen will show a big area with a map on the center. To explore the map you can use the Search bar located on the top left corner. Simply type the name of a place or a street address and click enter/return or the search icon. You can also use the Navigation controls (zoom in +/zoom out -/show my location) located on the top right corner of the map.\n02 Type the name of a place in the search bar.\nWhen you type the name of a place in the Search bar, OSM will show you a list of options found in Nominatim.\n\n Nominatim is an open-source geocoding software used to find addresses and places in OSM.\n\nHere we typed Philadelphia and we get six main results: the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the county with the same name, a town named Philadelphia in Mississippi and three other villages named like that in other states. Notice the map has zoomed in to the city of Philadelphia, PA. The results you get are based on the current view of your map. If you want to see more results you can click on the button More results.\n\n03 Click on the result you want to explore.\nWhen you click on a result, the left panel will show the selected element info and tags. On the map, you would see the element highlighted in orange.\n\nIn this example we see an area highlighted in orange that corresponds to the city of Philadelphia along with a node in the center of this area. On the left side panel we see a list with all the tags assigned to this element. For example: border_type:city, boundary:administrative, and loc_name:Philly.\n\nHow data is organized in OSM?\n\nAll data in OSM is represented by an element.An element can be either a node (point), a way (line) or a relation (group of elements).Each element is described using tags which are the combination of a key and a value . For example a coffee shop os represented by an element of type node with tags ‘amenity’=‘cafe’\n\n\nLearn more about elements and tags here.\n\n\n3.1.1 Querying the data\nNow lets query the data we see on the map to discover the type of element and what tags are being used to describe it.\n04 Type the name of a place in the search bar.\nWe are going to explore a more local area by typing charles library, philadelphia in the search bar. This will zoom in the map further.\n\n05 Click on the ‘Query features’ tool.\nOn the right side of the screen, click on the Query features tool \nYou will notice the mouse cursor icon will change to a question mark.\n06 Click on any element you see on the map to query.\nNow, if you click on any area of the map, the left side panel will show two lists: ‘Nearby features’ and ‘Enclosing features’. The Nearby feaures list will have all elements close to the point you clicked on the map. In this example, we got seven results.\n\n07 Explore the results.\nIf you click on any of the results, the left side panel will show the element details and tags. In this example, we clicked on ‘Saxbys’, which is a coffee shop by Charles Library.\nAs you can see, this element has five tags that describe it including its name, opening hours, and wheelchair accessibility. An element can have unlimited number of tags, however, some of them might be auto-exclusive. See more details on OSM tagging system here.\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\nTo add or modify tags and elements on the map you need to sign up for an OSM account here.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 In Overture Maps\n\n\n3.3 In QGIS\n\n\n4 Downloading the data"
