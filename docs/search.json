    "text": "2 Sources reviewed in this tutorial\nIn this guide, we’ll explore ways to access and use open geospatial data, focusing on OpenStreetMap and Overture Maps for Geographic Information Systems (QGIS specifically). These tools are powerful resources that anyone can use to work with location-based data.\n\n2.1 OpenStreetMap OSM\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative world map that anyone can edit and use - think of it like “Wikipedia for maps.” It is created by volunteers worldwide who add and update geographic information about roads, buildings, parks, businesses, and other features. People contribute data based on their local knowledge, GPS tracks, aerial imagery, and field surveys.\nKey aspects of OSM:\n\nCommunity-driven: The data is collected and maintained by a global community of mappers, from hobbyists to professional geographers.\nTruly open: Unlike commercial maps, OSM data is freely available for anyone to download, use, and modify under an open license (Open Database License).\nUsed everywhere: The data powers thousands of applications and services - from humanitarian crisis response to navigation apps, urban planning tools, and games.\nConstantly updated: Because anyone can contribute, OSM often has more up-to-date information than commercial maps, especially in rapidly changing areas or after natural disasters.\n\nThese are only some of the communities building OSM. Explore more communities here\n\nThe project started in 2004 in the UK and has grown into one of the largest collaborative mapping efforts in the world. Today, OSM is often considered the most comprehensive free source of geographic data available.\nAlthough you don’t need an account to explore the map, you can sign up if you want to contribute edits or be part of the communities related to the project.\n\n\n\n2.2 Overture Maps\n\nOverture Maps is a newer collaborative effort launched in 2022 by major tech companies including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), and TomTom. It combines information from multiple sources - including commercial datasets, open data, and machine learning - to create a high-quality, standardized global map.\nKey aspects of Overture Maps:\n\nQuality-focused: It uses sophisticated data validation and conflation techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency of geographic information.\nBusiness-friendly: While free and open like OSM, it’s specifically designed to meet enterprise-level mapping needs with reliable, standardized data.\nModern architecture: Built from the ground up to handle today’s mapping challenges, with a focus on regular updates and clear data lineage.\nMultiple sources: Instead of relying solely on volunteer contributions, it combines different data sources including commercial data, open data, and machine-derived features.\n\nThe project released its first major dataset in 2023 and aims to provide an alternative foundation for building mapping applications and services. While newer than OSM, it’s designed to complement rather than compete with existing open mapping projects."

    "text": "3 Exploring the data\n\n3.1 In OpenStreetMap\n01 Go to https://www.openstreetmap.org/ on your web browser\n\nThe screen will show a big area with a map on the center. To explore the map you can use the Search bar located on the top left corner. Simply type the name of a place or a street address and click enter/return or the search icon. You can also use the Navigation controls (zoom in +/zoom out -/show my location) located on the top right corner of the map.\n02 Type the name of a place in the search bar.\nWhen you type the name of a place in the Search bar, OSM will show you a list of options found in Nominatim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNominatim is an open-source geocoding software used to find addresses and places in OSM.\n\n\nHere we typed Philadelphia and we get six main results: the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the county with the same name, a town named Philadelphia in Mississippi and three other villages named like that in other states. Notice the map has zoomed in to the city of Philadelphia, PA. The results you get are based on the current view of your map. If you want to see more results you can click on the button More results.\n\n03 Click on the result you want to explore.\nWhen you click on a result, the left panel will show the selected element info and tags. On the map, you would see the element highlighted in orange.\n\nIn this example we see an area highlighted in orange that corresponds to the city of Philadelphia along with a node in the center of this area. On the left side panel we see a list with all the tags assigned to this element. For example: border_type:city, boundary:administrative, and loc_name:Philly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow data is organized in OSM?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll data in OSM is represented by an element.\nAn element can be either a node , a way  or a relation .\nEach element is described using tags which are the combination of a key and a value . For example, a coffee shop is represented by an element type node with tags amenity=cafe.\nLearn more about elements and tags here.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Querying the data\nNow lets query the data we see on the map to discover the type of element and what tags are being used to describe it.\n04 Type the name of a place in the search bar.\nWe are going to explore a more local area by typing charles library, philadelphia in the search bar. This will zoom in the map further.\n\n05 Click on the ‘Query features’ tool.\nOn the right side of the screen, click on the Query features tool \nYou will notice the mouse cursor icon will change to a question mark.\n06 Click on any element you see on the map to query.\nNow, if you click on any area of the map, the left side panel will show two lists: ‘Nearby features’ and ‘Enclosing features’. The Nearby feaures list will have all elements close to the point you clicked on the map. In this example, we got seven results.\n\n07 Explore the results.\nIf you click on any of the results, the left side panel will show the element details and tags. In this example, we clicked on ‘Saxbys’, which is a coffee shop by Charles Library.\nAs you can see, this element has five tags that describe it including its name, opening hours, and wheelchair accessibility. An element can have unlimited number of tags, however, some of them might be auto-exclusive. See more details on OSM tagging system here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\n\nTo add or modify tags and elements on the map you need to sign up for an OSM account here.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 In Overture Maps\n01 Go to https://explore.overturemaps.org/ on your web browser\n\n02 Find your location on the map\nUnlike OSM, the Overture Maps explorer does not have a search bar. The best way to find a location is either clicking on the ‘Find my location’ button  or using the navigation controls (zoom in and zoom out).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllow access to your location\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time you use the ‘Find my location’ tool, you will be asked to allow the browser access. If you are ok with this, simply click on ‘Allow this time’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03 Click on any of the features you see on the map\nWhen you click on any feature on the map, a popup window will display the feature(s) you clicked on, the bounding features (those that contain the clicked feature, like the city, the county it is on). This popup window will display the names of the features along with icons that represent the feature ‘type’. In this example we can see there is a ‘Charles Library’ place  and building .\n\nOn the left side of the screen, an ‘Inspector Panel’ will show the properties of the selected feature, including: the type, sources, names and others depending on the feature type.\n\n\n3.3 In QGIS\nThere are some ways to explore OpenStreetMap data in QGIS without downloading the data. The easiest way to do this is using OSM raster tiles. Follow the steps below to see OSM data in QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall QGIS\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have QGIS installed, go to https://qgis.org/download/ and follow the instructions to download the latest version for you operating system.\n\n\n\n01 Open QGIS\n\n02 Add a raster tile connection\nIn the Browser panel, right-click on XYZ Tiles, then click on New connection.\n\n03 Set the new XYZ connection\nIn the new window, type OSM as the name for your connection. Then copy and paste this line https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png in the URL space under ‘Connection Details’.\nThen click OK.\n\n04 Add the XYZ tiles to the map\nFind the OSM XYZ raster tiles you created on previous step on the Browser panel and drag it to the Layers panel or directly to the map area.\n\n05 Zoom in to the desired area on the map\nUsing the zoom in tools located in the top of the screen on QGIS you can locate the area you want to see. The map will show more details based on the level of zoom you are in. Ypu can use this raster tiles as a basemap in your projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\n\nOSM tiles are served through the internet. The speed at which the map loads depends on your internet connection."

    "title": "Using Open Geospatial Data in GIS",
    "section": "4 Downloading the data",
    "text": "4 Downloading the data\nThere are multiple ways to download data from OSM and Overture Maps. In this tutorial we focus on how to download data directly to QGIS.\n\n4.1 From OSM to QGIS\n01 Install QuickOSM plugin\nOpen QGIS.\nOn the top menu bar click on ‘Plugins’ and then on ‘Manage and Install Plugins’.\n\nOn the new window, in the search bar type quickosm, then click on ‘Install plugin’. Once installed, close the plugins manager window. Learn more about QuickOSM plugin\n\n02 Build a query to download data\n‘QuickOSM’ plugin uses overpass API, which is is a read-only interface that allows users to query and extract specific data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database using a custom query language.\nTo build a custom query:\n\nClick on the ‘QuickOSM’ button on the toolbar \nOn the new window:\n\n\nAdd amenity on the key space and parking on the value space.\nAdd Philadelphia, PA on the ‘in’ space.\nClick on ‘Run query’.\n\n\nThis will generate a query to retrieve all elements tagged as ‘amenity’=‘parking’ in the city of Philadelphia.\nAfter the download is done, close the ‘QuickOSM’ window and go back to the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLearn more on how overpass queries work in this tutorial.\n\n\n03 Save and style the layers\nThe data downloaded is stored as a temporary file in your system.\n\nIf you want to use it further from this session in QGIS you first need to save the files in your system.\nTo do so:\n\nRight click on the name of the layer you want to save.\nClick on the option ‘Make permanent’ or ‘Export’ and then ‘Save feature as…’.\nIn the new window, select the format for your file, a name and, a location.\nThen click ‘OK’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo further\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other options to download data usin ‘QuickOSM’ plugin.\nYou can try preset downloads, play around with different combinations of key and value, or download all data for a specific area. To download all data for a specific area, take into account that the amount of data can exceed your system capacity. Start downloading smaller areas to test.\nFor example, zoom in to a neighborhood or block, then in the ‘QuickOSM’ plugin window use ‘Canvas Extent’ then execute the query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 From Overture Maps\nTo download data from Overture Maps directly to QGIS we are going to use two plugins:\nQduckDB and GeoParquet Downloader.\nFollow the steps forward to download data directly to QGIS.\n01 Install DuckDB plugin\nOpen QGIS.\nOn the top menu bar click on ‘Plugins’ and then on ‘Manage and Install Plugins’.\n\nOn the new window, in the search bar type qduckdb, then click on ‘Install plugin’. Once installed, close the plugins manager window.\n Go back to the Plugins amanger and check that the ‘QduckDB’ plugin is activated (with a check mark).\n If not, check the box.\nIf you get an error message, follow the instructions in the following warining box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the oprating system you are using, the QduckDB plugin will need some extra steps to function correctly.\nOn MacOS:\n\nOpen the terminal app \nType the following:\n\n/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/python3.9 -m pip install \"duckdb==1.2.0\"\n\nIn terminal, locate and open the plugin file by typing:\n\nopen ~/Library/'Application Support'/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/qduckdb/gui/\n\nOpen the file dlg_add_duckdb_layer.py on a text editor app. \nAdd the followin to line 3:\n\nimport typing\n\nReplace the text on line 89 with:\n\ndef db_path(self) -&gt; typing.Union[Path, None]:\n\nSave the file.\nReopen QGIS.\nActivate QduckDB plugin.\n\nHere you can find instructions for other OS.\n\n\n\n02 Install GeoParquet Downloader plugin\nOn the top menu bar click on ‘Plugins’ and then on ‘Manage and Install Plugins’.\n\nOn the new window, in the search bar type geoparquet downloader, then click on ‘Install plugin’. Once installed, close the plugins manager window.\n\nYou should see the following icons on your tool bar \nIf not, right click on any empty space on the tool bar and activate the ‘Plugins toolbar’. \n03 Select the data source and type to download\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGeoParquet is a geospatial extension of ‘Apache Parquet’ format that efficiently stores geographic data in a columnar structure. It provides optimized compression, native support for geometries (points, lines, polygons), and includes spatial metadata like coordinate reference systems.\n\n\n\nClick on the ‘Download GeoParquet Data’ button on the toolbar \nIn the new window, select the source ‘Overture Maps’ and the types you want to download. \nSet a directory and name where you want to save the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\n\nThe ‘GeoParquet Downloader’ will download data for the current map extent. Be sure to limite the view to a local area to avoid saturating the download process.\n\n\nOnce the download is complete you should see a message like this: \n04 Open the downloaded data\n\nClick on the ‘Open Parquet with DuckDB’ button on the toolbar \nPoint to the file you downloaded in the previous step and set EPSG:4326 as the CRS.\nClick ‘Open’\n\n\nThe resulting map shows all places around Temple University downloaded from Overture Maps"
