## Why Open Geospatial Data?

In the world of data, `open` means different things. First, it's about who can access and use the data. Second, it's about how that data can be used - from the transparency of its creation and handling to the standards and protocols that make the data accessible.

Thanks to advances in computing and the internet, many organizations now embrace open data policies to share, access, and create value from data.

Having an open data policy offers several key benefits:

- Greater transparency, especially for governments. When data is open, citizens can see and understand what their government is doing.

- Increased public participation. Open data allows citizens to engage with and contribute to solutions for their communities.

- Faster and more significant advances in knowledge. Instead of spending time and money generating new data, researchers can build on existing information.

- Better reproducibility of research results. Other scientists can verify and build upon previous work.

- Improved informed decision-making, particularly for global-scale problems. When decision-makers have access to good data, they make better choices.

Open geospatial data is especially crucial for tackling global challenges like climate change, urban development, and disaster response. In these situations, quick access to accurate location-based information can make the difference in coordinating effective responses and making smart decisions.


## Sources reviewed in this tutorial

In this guide, we'll explore ways to access and use open geospatial data, focusing on OpenStreetMap and Overture Maps for Geographic Information Systems (QGIS specifically). These tools are powerful resources that anyone can use to work with location-based data.

### OpenStreetMap OSM

![](./images/osmlogo.png){width=150}

[OpenStreetMap](openstreemap.org) (OSM) is a collaborative world map that anyone can edit and use - think of it like "Wikipedia for maps."
It is created by volunteers worldwide who add and update geographic information about roads, buildings, parks, businesses, and other features. People contribute data based on their local knowledge, GPS tracks, aerial imagery, and field surveys.

Key aspects of OSM:

- **Community-driven:** The data is collected and maintained by a global community of mappers, from hobbyists to professional geographers.

- **Truly open:** Unlike commercial maps, OSM data is freely available for anyone to download, use, and modify under an open license (Open Database License).

- **Used everywhere:** The data powers thousands of applications and services - from humanitarian crisis response to navigation apps, urban planning tools, and games.

- **Constantly updated:** Because anyone can contribute, OSM often has more up-to-date information than commercial maps, especially in rapidly changing areas or after natural disasters.

These are only some of the communities building OSM. Explore more communities [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/communities)

The project started in 2004 in the UK and has grown into one of the largest collaborative mapping efforts in the world. Today, OSM is often considered the most comprehensive free source of geographic data available.

Although you don't need an account to explore the map, you can [sign up](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) if you want to contribute edits or be part of the communities related to the project.

### Overture Maps

![](./images/overturelogo.png){width=300}

[Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org/) is a newer collaborative effort launched in 2022 by major tech companies including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), and TomTom. It combines information from multiple sources - including commercial datasets, open data, and machine learning - to create a high-quality, standardized global map.

Key aspects of Overture Maps:

- **Quality-focused:** It uses sophisticated data validation and conflation techniques to ensure accuracy and consistency of geographic information.

- **Business-friendly:** While free and open like OSM, it's specifically designed to meet enterprise-level mapping needs with reliable, standardized data.

- **Modern architecture:** Built from the ground up to handle today's mapping challenges, with a focus on regular updates and clear data lineage.

- **Multiple sources:** Instead of relying solely on volunteer contributions, it combines different data sources including commercial data, open data, and machine-derived features.

The project released its first major dataset in 2023 and aims to provide an alternative foundation for building mapping applications and services. While newer than OSM, it's designed to complement rather than compete with existing open mapping projects.

## Exploring the data

### In OpenStreetMap

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">01</span> *Go to [https://www.openstreetmap.org/](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) on your web browser*

![](./images/osm_tools.png)

The screen will show a big area with a map on the center. 
To explore the map you can use the `Search` bar located on the top left corner. Simply type the name of a place or a street address and click `enter/return` or the search icon. 
You can also use the `Navigation controls` (zoom in +/zoom out -/show my location) located on the top right corner of the map. 

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">02</span> *Type the name of a place in the search bar.*

When you type the name of a place in the `Search` bar, OSM will show you a list of options found in `Nominatim`. 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-primary">
  <strong></strong> <a href="https://nominatim.org/" class="alert-link">Nominatim</a> is an open-source geocoding software used to find addresses and places in OSM.
</div>

Here we typed `Philadelphia` and we get six main results: the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the county with the same name, a town named Philadelphia in Mississippi and three other villages named like that in other states. Notice the map has zoomed in to the city of Philadelphia, PA. The results you get are based on the current view of your map. If you want to see more results you can click on the button `More results`.

![](./images/search_osm.png)

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">03</span> *Click on the result you want to explore.*

When you click on a result, the left panel will show the selected element info and tags. 
On the map, you would see the element highlighted in orange. 

![](./images/element1.png)

In this example we see an area highlighted in orange that corresponds to the city of Philadelphia along with a node in the center of this area.
On the left side panel we see a list with all the tags assigned to this element. For example: `border_type:city`, `boundary:administrative`, and `loc_name:Philly`.


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-primary">
  <strong>How data is organized in OSM?</strong><br></br><p>All data in OSM is represented by an <strong>element</strong>.<br></br>An <strong>element</strong> can be either a <strong>node</strong> (point)<img src="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/7/76/Osm_element_node.svg" style="width: 3%; height: auto;">, a <strong>way</strong> (line) <img src="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/e/ee/Osm_element_way.svg" style="width: 3%; height: auto;">or a <strong>relation</strong> (group of elements)<img src="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/4/48/Osm_element_relation.svg" style="width: 3%; height: auto;">.<br></br>Each element is described using <strong>tags</strong> which are the combination of a <strong>key</strong> and a <strong>value</strong> <img src="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/0/0d/Mf_tag.svg" style="width: 30px; height: 30px; background-color: white; padding: 0px;">. For example a coffee shop os represented by an element of type <strong>node</strong> with tags <strong>'amenity'='cafe'</strong></p><p>Learn more about elements and tags <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements'>here</a>.
</div>

#### Querying the data

Now lets query the data we see on the map to discover the type of element and what tags are being used to describe it.

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">04</span> *Type the name of a place in the search bar.*

We are going to explore a more local area by typing `charles library, philadelphia` in the search bar.
This will zoom in the map further. 

![](./images/charlesosm.png)

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">05</span> *Click on the 'Query features' tool.*

On the right side of the screen, click on the `Query features` tool ![](./images/queryosm.png)

You will notice the mouse cursor icon will change to a question mark.

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">06</span> *Click on any element you see on the map to query.*

Now, if you click on any area of the map, the left side panel will show two lists: 'Nearby features' and 'Enclosing features'. 
The Nearby feaures list will have all elements close to the point you clicked on the map. In this example, we got seven results.

![](./images/queryosm1.png)

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary">07</span> *Explore the results.*

If you click on any of the results, the left side panel will show the element details and tags.
In this example, we clicked on 'Saxbys', which is a coffee shop by Charles Library.

As you can see, this element has five tags that describe it including its name, opening hours, and wheelchair accessibility. An element can have unlimited number of tags, however, some of them might be auto-exclusive. See more details on OSM tagging system here.

![](./images/queryosm2.png)

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
  <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert"></button>
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Warning!</h4>
  <p class="mb-0">To add or modify tags and elements on the map you need to sign up for an OSM account <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new" class="alert-link">here</a>.</p>
